This is a project from my 2023 winter half-term, studying AS Level Computer Science.  
I was bored and our class looked at basic architecture before the break, and I wanted to potentially look further into compiler design personally, 
so I decided to start by creating something much simpler, but which utilised some of the same elements (in interpreting, etc.) 

Also I wanted to learn Swing, which came in very useful for my later A Level NEA.
